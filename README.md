## RACK AND UNRACK WEAPONS by dsvipeer

## A simple script that lets you rack/unrack big weapons from your car/police vehicle with proper animation to it.

      # Reminder: This only removes and give it back the weapon with predetermined acessories that are in the client.lua
      
            # To use inventory and others, you'll need to convert to whatever framework and inventory you're gonna use.
