# Rack-Unrack-Fivem-Script
A simple script that lets you rack/unrack big weapons from your car/police vehicle with proper animation to it.

# JUST ADD " ensure unrack " and " ensure mythic_progbar " !

# -- No support will be providen as it is standalone and it is working, just don't mess around in the client.lua.
# -- Credits to https://github.com/HalCroves and it's resource https://github.com/HalCroves/mythic_progbar .


# Resource commands: 

# /t4    (Rack M4) "CARBINE"
# /ret4 (Unrack M4) "CARBINE"

# /imbel ( Rack "CARBINE_MK2" )
# /reimb ( Unrack "CARBINE_MK2" )

T4 is a brazilian made weapon and imbel as well, so just ignore and change to whatever you want.

YOU CAN CHANGE ALL COMMANDS IN " client.lua " file!
