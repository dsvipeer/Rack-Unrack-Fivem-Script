## RACK AND UNRACK WEAPONS by dsvipeer

## A simple script that lets you rack/unrack big weapons from your car/police vehicle with proper animation to it.

      # Reminder: This only removes and give it back the weapon with predetermined acessories that are in the client.lua
      
            # To use inventory and others, you'll need to convert to whatever framework and inventory you're gonna use.

## :inbox_tray: **Installation**

- Drag and Drop into your resources folder

- Add "ensure unrack" into your server.cfg

- I've already added mythic_progbar, because it was with __resource.lua outdated and needed fxmanifest.lua, but feel free to go to [JayMontana](https://github.com/JayMontana36/mythic_progbar) and give him a star!

- Make sure to have [Mythic_progbar](https://github.com/JayMontana36/mythic_progbar) installed!
